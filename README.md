## Introduction 
Music is for me is an app that connects music students to teachers, coaches, and mentors.  Users can either search for instructors or instructors can connect to new or existing students.  Through the use of Spotify and React Player, API users can identify favorite musical genres or specific songs that the student would like to utilize for musical instruction.

To view the posts page, click the Posts tab on the navbar. Here you will initially see a list of every post on the site. Use the dropdown selection to choose if you would like to view posts from teachers or students and use the text input to search for specific topics you wish to teach or learn. Clicking on a post creator's name will let you visit their profile page which will contain their email address if you wish to contact them about their listing. Posts that belong to you will be slightly more dim than posts made by other users.
